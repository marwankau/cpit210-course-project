# CPIT210 Course Project
Introduction about your project, describe the problem, and your solution. Project truth tables, expressions, k-maps and any related task must included here. Also project documentation must included.

In this project students should work in groups of 3 to implement a fully functioning sequential circuit. This sequential circuit should work as a Buffer, a competition circuit, or 4-way light circuit depending on the student's choice. The idea of the three projects will be explained in the lab. To design the circuit, Logisim should be used. Students should submit their software implementation and the report here.
