# CPIT210 Course Project
Introduction about your project, describe the problem, and your solution. Project truth tables, expressions, k-maps and any related task must included here. Also project documentation must included.

In this project students should work in groups of 3 to implement a fully functioning sequential circuit. This sequential circuit should work as a Buffer, a competition circuit, or 4-way light circuit depending on the student's choice. The idea of the three projects will be explained in the lab. To design the circuit, Logisim should be used. Students should submit their software implementation and the report here. 

## Group Members

## Circuit Project topics:

[comment]: <> (Choose one of the following, your choice need to be accepted by Instructor)


### Traffic Light
#### Problem Statement
This circuit is used to control a four-way traffic light control system. In what follows, it makes each traffic light work when it’s needed to be green or yellow and when it’s not (Red). Students are asked to design, and implement the required circuit.

## Grading Factors
Each student's grade will defer from his group-mate 
- content and organization
- stating the problem need to be solved
- explanation of each component used
- explanation of whole circuit/integration of component
- how often you update/participate/contribute in group repository

## Deadline
Monday 29 / 7 / 1444 H, *20 Feb. 2023*

## Logic Expression
Include exported image from Logisim of your project here. *(Screenshot is not accepted!)*
